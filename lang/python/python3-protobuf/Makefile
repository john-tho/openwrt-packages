define Package/python3-protobuf/description
  Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral,
  extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but
  smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be
  structured once, then you can use special generated source code to
  easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of
  data streams and using a variety of languages.
